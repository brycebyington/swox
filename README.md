a lox interpreter written in swift based on Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom

## about
this is a port of Robert Nystrom's [jlox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master), originally written in java. my main goal for this project is to learn more about low-level programming and the work that goes into creating interpreters and compilers. i decided to write it in swift mostly because i don't like java, but also because i had been working on my other project [SwiftBrowser](https://github.com/brycebyington/SwiftBrowser/tree/main) and really enjoyed the experience of working in swift. i've found that it's a great language for stepping into low(er)-level prorgramming as someone who primarily writes javascript in my day job. writing swift feels natural, with the added benefits of being statically/strongly typed and less abstraction.
